Description Provides sample size and power calculations when the treatment time-lag effect
is present and the lag duration is either homogeneous across the individual subject,
or varies heterogeneously from individual to individual within a certain domain and
following a specific pattern. The methods used are described in two references:

delayed treatment effect <doi:10.1002/sim.7157>.

Description

An R package for sample size and power calculation when the treatment time-lag effect is present.

The package incorporates two specific assumptions on the lag duration:

1. the lag duration is homogeneous across the individual subject;

2. the lag duration varies heterogeneously from individual to individual within a certain domain and
following a specific pattern.
